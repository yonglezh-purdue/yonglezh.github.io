For people who chose the hard route. Stop fighting is not an option. 

What is the hard route? Perhaps there's no hard route. Every route is the same.

No, there is. For example, after Elon Musk earned a fortune selling PayPal, he could have done something else such as being a VC, but instead he put all of his money in SpaceX. 

Why do people chose the hard route?
