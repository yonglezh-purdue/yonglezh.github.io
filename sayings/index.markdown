Both the meaning and the expression of old sayings change over time. Despite the inherent ambiguity in natural language, there's still some truth in them.

> "There is nothing worse than being always ways on the tramp."

----

> "三人行，必有我师焉。"

- Open to advices, even judgments. But evaluate them objectively, not emotionally.
- Proactively learn from other people. 

----

> "业精于勤而荒于嬉，行成于思而毁于随。"

----

> "Leverage whatever you need to get things done."

- Note: It's "whatever you need" but not "whatever you have".

> "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails."

> "Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails. "

> "If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is."

- I don't think mathematics is simple, but I do agree that life is even more complicated.
