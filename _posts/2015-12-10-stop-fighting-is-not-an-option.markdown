When I first posted this, I didn't really write much other than the title. I think I was just trying to cheer myself up because I was going through a hard time. But now I think I still agree with it and I'll try to provide some explanation.

## What are we fighting against? 

A lot of things in our lives - illness, poorness, frustration, anxiety, disappointment, unsatisfied greed, or sometimes simply bad lucks. We all go through ups and downs in our lives. Life is not easy.

> "If you feel life is easy, someone else is taking your burden." 

## What does it mean to fight against these things? 

It means to survive them, to try our best to function normally despite their influence. 

## Why? 

There were so many times that I wanted to give up. There were so many times that I felt there's no point. 

BUT THERE IS A POINT. I choose to believe that we do have a purpose born into this world. That is to fully utilize our own talents to make this world a better place. 

It's hard to define what "better" is. But that doesn't mean I can use that as an excuse to do whatever satisfies my own interests. At every decision I make, reason whether it benefits the world/people around myself, make the right choice and pay the effort to carry it out. This is definitely a high requirement. I will fall short from time to time, but always try my best. 

At the end of day, there's no universal meaning of life. It's something that works for me.
